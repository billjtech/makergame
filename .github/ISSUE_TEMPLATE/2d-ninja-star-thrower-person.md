Project Description (Brief):

This project is for learning and development purposes/fun. It will be placed on github with surrounding project files for later improvements / help, in the hope that others in the github community want to join / help especially fellow noobs / enthusiasts.








Project Description (Detailed)

The game initial release will be simple (maybe / likely even unfinished haha).
There is a background, a ninja and fruit. The ninja has unlimited ninja stars to combat the fruit onslaught with. He will get fame or shame… By fruit.
This will be done on the 2D Godot platform with GDscript. Assets will be either made or borrowed from open source, or even better contributed by fellow Githubees..
